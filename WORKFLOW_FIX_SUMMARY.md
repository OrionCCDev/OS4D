# Task Workflow Fix - Summary

## Problem
After sending mail and waiting for client/consultant review, when the user clicked "Finish Review & Notify Manager", nothing happened. The system wasn't:
1. Changing the task status to indicate the manager needs to review the feedback
2. Transferring the task back to the manager
3. Providing manager with options to complete or request resubmission
4. Providing user with resubmit functionality

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
**Migration:** `database/migrations/2025_10_09_000003_add_review_after_reply_statuses_to_tasks.php`
- Added two new task statuses:
  - `in_review_after_client_consultant_reply` - Task is with manager for final review after client/consultant feedback
  - `re_submit_required` - Task sent back to user for resubmission

### 2. Task Model Updates (`app/Models/Task.php`)

#### Updated `finishReview()` method:
- Now changes task status to `in_review_after_client_consultant_reply`
- Properly transfers the task back to manager
- Includes status change in history and notification

#### Added new methods:
- `markAsCompleted($notes)` - Manager marks task as completed after reviewing client/consultant feedback
- `requireResubmit($notes)` - Manager sends task back to user for changes
- `resubmitTask()` - User resubmits task after making requested changes

#### Added notification methods:
- `notifyUserAboutCompletion()` - Notifies user when manager marks task complete
- `notifyUserAboutResubmit($notes)` - Notifies user when resubmission is required
- `notifyManagerAboutResubmit()` - Notifies manager when user resubmits

### 3. Controller Updates (`app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php`)

Added three new controller methods:
- `markAsCompleted(Request $request, Task $task)` - Handles manager completion action
- `requireResubmit(Request $request, Task $task)` - Handles manager resubmit request
- `resubmitTask(Request $request, Task $task)` - Handles user resubmission

### 4. Routes Updates (`routes/web.php`)

Added three new routes:
```php
Route::post('tasks/{task}/mark-completed', [TaskController::class, 'markAsCompleted'])->name('tasks.mark-completed');
Route::post('tasks/{task}/require-resubmit', [TaskController::class, 'requireResubmit'])->name('tasks.require-resubmit');
Route::post('tasks/{task}/resubmit', [TaskController::class, 'resubmitTask'])->name('tasks.resubmit');
```

### 5. View Updates (`resources/views/tasks/show.blade.php`)

#### Manager Actions (Status: `in_review_after_client_consultant_reply`):
- Shows combined response status and feedback from client/consultant
- "Mark as Completed" button - completes the task
- "Request Resubmission" button - sends task back to user with notes

#### User Actions (Status: `re_submit_required`):
- Shows manager's notes explaining required changes
- Shows client/consultant feedback for reference
- "Resubmit for Review" button - sends task back through the workflow

#### JavaScript Functions Added:
- `markAsCompleted(taskId)` - Handles mark as completed action
- `requireResubmit(taskId)` - Handles resubmit request action

## Workflow Flow

### Complete Flow:
1. User finishes recording client/consultant responses
2. User clicks "Finish Review & Notify Manager"
3. **Task status changes to `in_review_after_client_consultant_reply`**
4. **Manager receives notification**
5. Manager reviews the combined feedback
6. Manager chooses:
   - **Option A: Mark as Completed** → Task status changes to `completed`
   - **Option B: Request Resubmission** → Task status changes to `re_submit_required`

### Resubmission Flow:
1. User receives notification about resubmission requirement
2. User can see manager's notes and client/consultant feedback
3. User makes necessary changes
4. User clicks "Resubmit for Review"
5. **Task status changes back to `submitted_for_review`**
6. Normal workflow continues from there (Manager starts review → approve internally → send email → etc.)

## Key Features
- ✅ Task status automatically changes when review is finished
- ✅ Manager receives notification with all feedback
- ✅ Manager can complete task or request resubmission
- ✅ User receives clear notification when resubmission is needed
- ✅ User can see all feedback (manager + client + consultant)
- ✅ Resubmit button properly restarts the workflow
- ✅ All actions are logged in task history
- ✅ Proper authorization checks (only managers can complete/request resubmit, only assigned user can resubmit)

## Testing
To test the workflow:
1. Create a task and go through the normal workflow until "on_client_consultant_review" status
2. Record client and consultant responses
3. Click "Finish Review & Notify Manager"
4. Verify task status changes to `in_review_after_client_consultant_reply`
5. As manager, either mark as completed or request resubmission
6. If resubmitted, verify user can see feedback and resubmit the task
7. Verify task goes back to `submitted_for_review` status and continues normally
