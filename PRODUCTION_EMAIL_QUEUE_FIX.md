# 🚨 Production Email Queue Fix - Critical Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

Your email system with attachments was experiencing critical failures:

1. **Queue Worker Not Running**: Jobs were stuck in the database, never executing
2. **No Error Notifications**: Users didn't know when emails failed
3. **Long Wait Times**: Users had to stay on page until completion
4. **Silent Failures**: Emails failed without any notification
5. **Memory Issues**: Large attachments caused timeouts

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Job Processing**
- Added retry logic (3 attempts with backoff: 1min, 5min, 15min)
- Increased timeout to 300 seconds for large attachments
- Added garbage collection after each attachment
- Proper error handling with exceptions

### 2. **User Notifications System**
- Success notifications when email is sent
- Failure notifications with error details
- Manager notifications for all email events
- Database notifications visible in UI

### 3. **Queue Monitoring Dashboard**
- Real-time queue status monitoring
- Failed jobs management (retry, delete, flush)
- Stuck email detection and reset
- Statistics and analytics

### 4. **Optimized Attachment Handling**
- File size validation (100MB max)
- Memory-efficient processing
- Proper MIME type detection
- Error handling for missing files

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

### **Step 1: Run Diagnostic Script**

On your cPanel terminal, run:

```bash
cd /home/your-username/public_html  # Or your app path
php check_queue_status.php
```

**Expected Output:**
- Queue configuration status
- Number of pending jobs
- Number of failed jobs
- Queue worker status

📤 **SEND ME THE OUTPUT** so I can analyze your specific situation.

---

### **Step 2: Database Migration**

Run the migration to add error tracking:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This adds the `error_message` column to `task_email_preparations` table.

---

### **Step 3: Start Queue Worker (CRITICAL)**

You need to start the queue worker. There are **2 methods**:

#### **Method A: Supervisor (Recommended for cPanel)**

Create supervisor configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/odels-queue-worker.conf
```

Add this configuration:

```ini
[program:odels-queue-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /home/your-username/public_html/artisan queue:work database --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600 --timeout=300
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=your-username
numprocs=2
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/your-username/public_html/storage/logs/queue-worker.log
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

**Replace:**
- `your-username` with your actual cPanel username
- `/home/your-username/public_html` with your app path

Start supervisor:

```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start odels-queue-worker:*
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo supervisorctl status odels-queue-worker:*
```

#### **Method B: Cron Job (Alternative)**

If supervisor is not available, use cron:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line:

```cron
* * * * * cd /home/your-username/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Then add to `app/Console/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('queue:work --stop-when-empty')
             ->everyMinute()
             ->withoutOverlapping();
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Queue Worker is Running**

Run diagnostic again:

```bash
php check_queue_status.php
```

You should see:
```
✓ Queue worker appears to be running
```

---

### **Step 5: Process Stuck/Failed Jobs**

If you have pending jobs:

```bash
# Process all pending jobs
php artisan queue:work --once

# Or retry all failed jobs
php artisan queue:retry all
```

If you have stuck email preparations:

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\TaskEmailPreparation::where('status', 'processing')->where('created_at', '<', now()->subMinutes(10))->update(['status' => 'failed', 'error_message' => 'Stuck in processing - reset by admin']);
>>> exit
```

---

### **Step 6: Access Queue Monitor Dashboard**

1. Log in as a **Manager** user
2. Go to: `https://your-domain.com/admin/queue-monitor`
3. You'll see:
   - Queue worker status
   - Pending/failed jobs
   - Email statistics
   - Actions to retry/delete jobs

---

### **Step 7: Test Email Sending with Attachments**

1. Create a new task or use an existing one
2. Go to "Ready for Email" status
3. Attach a file (test with small file first, e.g., 1MB)
4. Click "Send Email"
5. You should see: **"Email is being sent in the background..."**
6. **DO NOT WAIT** - you can navigate away immediately
7. Check notifications (bell icon) - you'll receive success/failure notification

## 🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### How to Check Queue Status

**1. Web Dashboard:**
- Go to `/admin/queue-monitor`
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

**2. Command Line:**
```bash
# Check pending jobs
php artisan queue:failed

# Check queue statistics
php check_queue_status.php

# View logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Queue Worker Stops Unexpectedly

**Symptoms:**
- Pending jobs pile up
- Emails don't send
- Dashboard shows "Not Running"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart queue worker
sudo supervisorctl restart odels-queue-worker:*

# Or if using cron, wait for next minute
```

#### Issue 2: Jobs Keep Failing

**Symptoms:**
- Failed jobs table fills up
- Email notifications show failures
- Error messages in logs

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Common causes:
# - Gmail OAuth token expired → Users need to reconnect Gmail
# - SMTP credentials wrong → Check .env file
# - Attachment file not found → Check storage permissions
# - Memory limit → Increase PHP memory_limit in php.ini
```

#### Issue 3: Attachments Too Large

**Symptoms:**
- Timeout errors
- Job fails with "Attachment file too large"

**Solution:**
1. Check PHP settings:
```bash
php -i | grep upload_max_filesize
php -i | grep post_max_size
php -i | grep memory_limit
```

2. Update `php.ini`:
```ini
upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 100M
memory_limit = 512M
max_execution_time = 300
```

3. Update `.htaccess`:
```apache
php_value upload_max_filesize 100M
php_value post_max_size 100M
php_value memory_limit 512M
php_value max_execution_time 300
```

#### Issue 4: Email Stuck in "Processing"

**Symptoms:**
- Email shows "processing" for >10 minutes
- Job completed but status not updated

**Solution:**
1. Go to `/admin/queue-monitor`
2. Click "Reset Stuck Emails" button
3. Or manually:
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\TaskEmailPreparation::where('status', 'processing')->update(['status' => 'failed']);
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Increase Queue Worker Processes

For high-volume email sending:

```ini
# In supervisor config
numprocs=4  # Run 4 queue workers in parallel
```

### Database Queue Cleanup

Schedule periodic cleanup:

```bash
# Add to cron
0 2 * * * php /path/to/artisan queue:prune-batches --hours=48
0 3 * * * php /path/to/artisan queue:prune-failed --hours=168
```

### Monitor Memory Usage

```bash
# Check queue worker memory
ps aux | grep "queue:work"

# Restart workers periodically to prevent memory leaks
php artisan queue:restart
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Protect Queue Monitor:**
   - Only managers can access `/admin/queue-monitor`
   - Middleware: `auth` + `manager` role check

2. **Log Sensitive Data:**
   - Email content logged for debugging
   - Review `storage/logs/laravel.log` periodically
   - Consider log rotation

3. **Failed Job Data:**
   - Contains email data
   - Clean up periodically
   - Consider encryption for sensitive data

## 📈 Key Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Healthy Range | Action if Exceeded |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Pending Jobs | < 10 | Check queue worker running |
| Failed Jobs | < 5 | Investigate errors, retry |
| Stuck Emails | 0 | Reset and retry |
| Job Processing Time | < 60s | Optimize or increase workers |
| Queue Worker Memory | < 256MB | Restart workers |
