# EMAIL SENDER VERIFICATION GUIDE

## 🎯 GOAL
Verify that each user sends emails from their own email address and NOT from other users' addresses (token mixing bug fix).

## 📋 PRE-TEST CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Run Verification Script
```bash
cd /home/edlb2bdo7yna/public_html/odc.com
php verify_email_sender_fix.php
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎉 SUCCESS! All users have isolated email addresses!
🎉 The token mixing bug has been FIXED!
```

### Step 2: Prepare Test Environment
You need:
- **Browser 1 (Normal Mode)**: Login as Manager
- **Browser 1 (Private Window)**: Login as User 2  
- **Browser 2 (Any Mode)**: Login as User 3

## 🧪 REAL EMAIL SENDING TEST

### Test Setup:
Based on your users:
- **Manager**: `a.sayed@orioncc.com` (User ID: 2)
- **User 2**: `a.sayed.xc@gmail.com` (User ID: 3)
- **User 3**: `h.ahmed.moursy@gmail.com` (User ID: 4)

### Test Steps:

#### **Test 1: User 2 Email Sending**
1. **Browser 1 (Private Window)**: Login as `a.sayed.xc@gmail.com`
2. Go to any task with "Email Preparation" section
3. Fill in:
   - **To**: `test@example.com` (or your own email)
   - **Subject**: `Test from User 2 - $(date)`
   - **Body**: `This email should come from a.sayed.xc@gmail.com`
4. Click **"Send Email"**
5. **Expected Result**: Email should be sent from `a.sayed.xc@gmail.com`

#### **Test 2: User 3 Email Sending**
1. **Browser 2**: Login as `h.ahmed.moursy@gmail.com`
2. Go to any task with "Email Preparation" section
3. Fill in:
   - **To**: `test@example.com` (or your own email)
   - **Subject**: `Test from User 3 - $(date)`
   - **Body**: `This email should come from h.ahmed.moursy@gmail.com`
4. Click **"Send Email"**
5. **Expected Result**: Email should be sent from `h.ahmed.moursy@gmail.com`

#### **Test 3: Manager Email Sending**
1. **Browser 1 (Normal Mode)**: Login as `a.sayed@orioncc.com`
2. Go to any task with "Email Preparation" section
3. Fill in:
   - **To**: `test@example.com` (or your own email)
   - **Subject**: `Test from Manager - $(date)`
   - **Body**: `This email should come from a.sayed@orioncc.com`
4. Click **"Send Email"**
5. **Expected Result**: Email should be sent from `a.sayed@orioncc.com`

## 🔍 VERIFICATION STEPS

### Step 1: Check Logs for Email Sending
```bash
# Check for successful email sends
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Gmail email sent successfully"

# Should see something like:
# Gmail email sent successfully for user: 2 - Message ID: ...
# Gmail email sent successfully for user: 3 - Message ID: ...
# Gmail email sent successfully for user: 4 - Message ID: ...
```

### Step 2: Check Recipient Inboxes
**Most Important**: Check the actual received emails in the recipient's inbox:

1. **Open the received emails**
2. **Check the "From" field** in each email
3. **Verify**:
   - Email from User 2 shows: `From: a.sayed.xc@gmail.com`
   - Email from User 3 shows: `From: h.ahmed.moursy@gmail.com`
   - Email from Manager shows: `From: a.sayed@orioncc.com`

### Step 3: Verify No Cross-Contamination
**Critical Check**: None of the emails should show:
- ❌ User 2's email coming from Manager's address
- ❌ User 3's email coming from User 2's address
- ❌ Manager's email coming from User 3's address

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ✅ PASS - Fix Working:
- Each user's email shows correct "From" address
- No cross-contamination between users
- Logs show successful sends for each user ID
- All emails delivered successfully

### ❌ FAIL - Still Has Issues:
- Any email shows wrong "From" address
- Users sending from other users' accounts
- Emails not being delivered
- Error messages in logs

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Emails Show Wrong "From" Address:
1. **Check logs** for token mixing errors
2. **Verify Gmail connections** for all users
3. **Re-run verification script** to check isolation
4. **Clear caches** and try again

### If Emails Not Sending:
1. **Check queue worker** is running
2. **Verify Gmail OAuth tokens** are valid
3. **Check email limits** (Gmail API quotas)
4. **Look for error messages** in logs

### If Only Some Users Work:
1. **Check which users have Gmail connected**
2. **Verify Gmail tokens** for failing users
3. **Reconnect Gmail** for problematic users

## 📝 REPORTING RESULTS

After testing, report:

1. **✅/❌ User 2 email sent from correct address?**
2. **✅/❌ User 3 email sent from correct address?**
3. **✅/❌ Manager email sent from correct address?**
4. **✅/❌ No cross-contamination between users?**
5. **✅/❌ All emails delivered successfully?**
6. **Any error messages in logs?**

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOME

- ✅ Each user sending from their own email address
- ✅ No token mixing between users
- ✅ Proper email isolation
- ✅ Successful email delivery
- ✅ Confirmed fix of the original bug
