# Project-Contractor Many-to-Many Relationship Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a many-to-many relationship between projects and contractors with a modern, user-friendly interface for selecting contractors when creating or editing projects.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- **Migration**: `create_project_contractor_table.php`
  - Pivot table with `project_id`, `contractor_id`, `role`, `assigned_at`
  - Unique constraint on project-contractor combination
  - Foreign key constraints with cascade delete

### 2. Model Relationships
- **Project Model**:
  - `contractors()` - Many-to-many relationship
  - `clientContractors()`, `consultantContractors()`, `orionStaffContractors()` - Filtered relationships
  - `addContractor()`, `removeContractor()`, `updateContractorRole()` - Helper methods

- **Contractor Model**:
  - `projects()` - Many-to-many relationship
  - `activeProjects()`, `completedProjects()` - Filtered relationships

### 3. User Interface Components
- **Contractor Selector Component** (`resources/views/components/contractor-selector.blade.php`):
  - Search functionality by name, email, or company
  - Filter by contractor type (All, Orion Staff, Clients, Consultants)
  - Checkbox selection with visual feedback
  - Selected contractors summary
  - Responsive design with modern styling

### 4. Form Integration
- **Project Create Form**: Added contractor selection with filtering
- **Project Edit Form**: Shows currently assigned contractors
- **Project Show Page**: Displays assigned contractors with type badges

### 5. Controller Updates
- **ProjectController**:
  - `create()`: Loads contractors for selection
  - `store()`: Handles contractor assignment during project creation
  - `edit()`: Loads contractors and selected contractors
  - `update()`: Syncs contractor relationships
  - `show()`: Loads contractors for display

## Usage

### Creating a Project with Contractors
1. Navigate to project creation form
2. Fill in project details
3. Use the contractor selector to choose contractors:
   - Filter by type using the toggle buttons
   - Search by name, email, or company
   - Select multiple contractors using checkboxes
4. Save the project

### Editing Project Contractors
1. Go to project edit page
2. Modify contractor selections in the contractor selector
3. Save changes

### Viewing Project Contractors
- Project show page displays all assigned contractors
- Contractors are grouped by type with color-coded badges
- Shows contractor details (name, email, company)

## Technical Details

### Contractor Types
- **Orion Staff**: Blue badge, primary color
- **Clients**: Green badge, success color  
- **Consultants**: Light blue badge, info color

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_contractor (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id BIGINT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    contractor_id BIGINT REFERENCES contractors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(project_id, contractor_id)
);
```

### JavaScript Features
- Real-time search filtering
- Type-based filtering
- Dynamic selected contractors summary
- Responsive UI interactions

## Benefits
1. **Flexible Assignment**: Projects can have multiple contractors of different types
2. **Easy Management**: Intuitive interface for selecting and managing contractors
3. **Type Organization**: Clear visual distinction between contractor types
4. **Search & Filter**: Quick contractor lookup and selection
5. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes
6. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints and unique constraints

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk contractor assignment
- Contractor role management within projects
- Contractor performance tracking per project
