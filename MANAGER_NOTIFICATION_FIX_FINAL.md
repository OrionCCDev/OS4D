# Manager Notification Fix - Time Extension Requests

## Problem
Managers were not receiving notifications when users requested time extensions. They could only see the requests inside the task view.

## Root Cause
The `notifyManagers()` method in the Task model was being used, which skips the current user. When a regular user (non-manager) requested an extension, the method was being called but may have had issues with the notification system integration.

## Solution
Changed the notification approach to send notifications **directly** to all managers using `UnifiedNotification::createTaskNotification()` instead of going through the `notifyManagers()` method.

### Code Change

**Before:**
```php
$task->notifyManagers(
    'time_extension_requested',
    'Time Extension Requested',
    $requestMessage
);
```

**After:**
```php
// Send notification directly to ALL managers for time extension requests
foreach ($managers as $manager) {
    UnifiedNotification::createTaskNotification(
        $manager->id,
        'time_extension_requested',
        'Time Extension Requested',
        $requestMessage,
        [
            'task_id' => $task->id,
            'project_id' => $task->project_id,
            'due_date' => $task->due_date ? $task->due_date->format('Y-m-d') : null,
            'extension_request_id' => $extensionRequest->id,
            'requester_name' => $assigneeName,
            'requested_days' => $validated['requested_days'],
            'reason' => $validated['reason']
        ],
        $task->id,
        'high'
    );
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **All managers get notified** - No skipping based on current user
✅ **Direct notification creation** - Bypasses potential issues in notifyManagers method
✅ **Complete metadata** - Includes all relevant information
✅ **High priority** - Notifications marked as important
✅ **Better logging** - Detailed logs for debugging

## What Happens Now

1. **User requests time extension**
   - Notification sent directly to ALL managers (admin, manager, sub-admin)
   - Managers see notification in their notification panel
   - Notification includes: requester name, days, task title, and reason
   
2. **Manager views task**
   - Can see pending requests in the yellow warning card
   - Also has notification linking to the task

3. **Manager approves/rejects**
   - User receives notification of the decision

## Testing

1. User submits a time extension request
2. Check manager accounts - they should receive notifications
3. Notification should appear in notification panel
4. Clicking notification should lead to the task

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- ✅ All managers receive notifications (no skipping)
- ✅ Notifications are created in the database
- ✅ Notifications are marked as high priority
- ✅ Complete information is included
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Files Modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php` (line ~2506)
  - Changed from `$task->notifyManagers()` to direct `UnifiedNotification::createTaskNotification()`
  - Added loop to send to all managers
  - Added complete metadata
