## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Migrations

   - **Name**: Manager's full name
   - **Orion ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., "PM001")
   - **Email**: Manager's email address
   - **Mobile**: Manager's mobile number (optional)
3. Click "Create"
4. You should be redirected to the project managers list with a success message

### Step 4: Assign Project Manager to a Project
1. Navigate to Projects
2. Click "New Project" or edit an existing project
3. In the form, you'll see a "Project Manager" dropdown
4. Select a project manager from the list
5. Save the project

### Step 5: View Project Manager Details
1. Go to Project Managers list
2. Click the "View" icon on any project manager
3. You'll see:

## Testing Checklist

### Database Tests
- [ ] Run migrations successfully
- [ ] Verify `project_managers` table exists with correct columns
- [ ] Verify `projects` table has `project_manager_id` column
- [ ] Verify foreign key constraint works

### CRUD Tests
- [ ] Create a new project manager
- [ ] View the project manager in the list
- [ ] Edit the project manager details
- [ ] Delete a project manager with no projects
- [ ] Attempt to delete a project manager with assigned projects (should fail with error message)

### Relationship Tests
- [ ] Create a project without a project manager (should work)
- [ ] Create a project with a project manager (should work)
- [ ] Assign a project manager to an existing project
- [ ] View projects assigned to a project manager
- [ ] Reassign a project to a different manager

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Navigation menu shows "Project Managers"
- [ ] Create form has all required fields
- [ ] Edit form pre-fills with existing data
- [ ] Show page displays all manager details and projects
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Success/error messages display correctly
- [ ] Project forms show project manager dropdown

## Production Testing Steps

Since you're on a live production app, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Backup Database** (Important!)
   ```bash
   # In cPanel terminal or SSH
   mysqldump -u your_username -p database_name > backup_before_project_managers.sql
   ```

2. **Run Migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

3. **Test Creation of Project Manager**
   - Log in as manager
   - Navigate to Project Managers
   - Create a test project manager

4. **Test Assignment to Project**
   - Create or edit a project
   - Select the project manager
   - Save and verify

5. **Test View and Edit**
   - View the project manager details
   - Edit the project manager
   - Verify changes are saved

6. **Test Delete Protection**
   - Try to delete a project manager with assigned projects
   - Verify error message appears
   - Unassign projects and try again

7. **Rollback if Needed**
   If something goes wrong:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2
   ```

## Relationship Details

### Project Manager → Projects
- **Type**: One-to-Many
- **Project Manager**: Can manage many projects
- **Project**: Belongs to one project manager (optional)

### Database Schema
```
project_managers
├── id
├── name
├── orion_id (unique)
├── email (unique)
├── mobile
├── created_at
├── updated_at
└── deleted_at (soft deletes)

projects
├── ...
├── project_manager_id (nullable, foreign key to project_managers.id)
└── ...
```

## Notes
- Project managers are soft-deletable
- A project manager cannot be deleted if they have assigned projects
- Orion ID and email must be unique
- Mobile number is optional
- Projects are not required to have a project manager (nullable relationship)

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- Check database user permissions
- Verify Laravel environment configuration
- Check for existing columns that might conflict

### Foreign Key Error
- Ensure `project_managers` table exists before adding foreign key
- Check table names are correct

### Route Not Found
- Clear route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
- Run: `php artisan optimize:clear`

### Views Not Found
- Clear view cache: `php artisan view:clear`
- Verify file paths are correct
