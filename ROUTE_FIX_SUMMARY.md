# Route Fix Summary

## Problem
The email preparation page was throwing a `RouteNotFoundException` because the form was trying to use a route name that didn't exist.

## Error Details
```
Route [tasks.email-preparation.store] not defined.
```

## Root Cause
The form action was using the wrong route name:
- **Incorrect**: `tasks.email-preparation.store`
- **Correct**: `tasks.store-email-preparation`

## Fix Applied
Updated the form action in `resources/views/tasks/email-preparation.blade.php`:

```php
// Before (incorrect)
<form id="emailForm" method="POST" action="{{ route('tasks.email-preparation.store', $task) }}">

// After (correct)
<form id="emailForm" method="POST" action="{{ route('tasks.store-email-preparation', $task) }}">
```

## Verified Routes
✅ `tasks.store-email-preparation` - exists in routes/web.php line 192
✅ `tasks.mark-email-sent` - exists in routes/web.php line 194
✅ `storeEmailPreparation` method - exists in TaskController.php line 629
✅ `markEmailAsSent` method - exists in TaskController.php line 194

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The email preparation page should now load without route errors.

## Next Steps
1. Refresh the email preparation page
2. Test the form submission functionality
3. Verify the Send via Gmail button works
4. Test the Mark as Sent functionality
