# Email Signature Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ Problem Fixed

Email signatures were not appearing at the bottom of sent emails because:
1. **HTML was being escaped** in email templates (converting `<div>` to `&lt;div&gt;`)
2. **Signatures weren't being added** in some email sending methods

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Email Templates - Removed HTML Escaping
Changed from `{!! nl2br(e($bodyContent)) !!}` to `{!! $bodyContent !!}` in:
- ✅ `resources/views/emails/user-general-email-gmail.blade.php`
- ✅ `resources/views/emails/user-general-email.blade.php`  
- ✅ `resources/views/emails/general-email.blade.php`

### 2. TaskController - Added Signature Generation
Added signature to email body in `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php`:
- ✅ `sendGeneralEmail()` method - adds signature for user emails
- ✅ `sendGeneralEmailNotification()` method - adds signature for engineering notifications

## 🔒 Security Maintained

User input is still escaped to prevent XSS attacks:
```php
// User input is escaped
$bodyWithSignature = nl2br(e($validated['body'])) . '<br><br>' . $signature;

// Then passed unescaped to template (because signature HTML is trusted)
Template: {!! $bodyContent !!}
```

## 📋 Testing Steps

1. **Test Profile Preview:**
   - Go to `/profile`
   - Scroll to "Email Signature Preview"
   - Verify your signature displays correctly with logo, name, email, position

2. **Test Email Sending:**
   - Send a general email or task confirmation email
   - Check received email
   - **Verify signature appears at bottom** with proper formatting

3. **What the Signature Includes:**
   - ✅ Orion Contracting logo
   - ✅ Your profile image (if not default)
   - ✅ Your name (blue, clickable)
   - ✅ Your position and department
   - ✅ Your email (clickable)
   - ✅ Your mobile number (clickable, if set)
