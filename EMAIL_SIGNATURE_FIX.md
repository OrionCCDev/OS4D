# Email Signature Display Fix - Complete Guide

## Problem Summary

The email signature preview on user/manager profiles was displaying correctly in the preview, but signatures were not appearing at the bottom of sent emails. This was due to HTML escaping in email templates.

## Issues Identified

### 1. HTML Escaping in Email Templates
The email templates were using `{!! nl2br(e($bodyContent)) !!}` which escaped HTML entities, preventing the signature HTML from rendering properly.

**Affected Files:**
- `resources/views/emails/user-general-email-gmail.blade.php`
- `resources/views/emails/user-general-email.blade.php`
- `resources/views/emails/general-email.blade.php`

### 2. Missing Signature in General Emails
The `TaskController::sendGeneralEmail()` method was not adding signatures to the email body before sending.

**Affected File:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php`

### 3. Notification Emails Missing Signatures
The `sendGeneralEmailNotification()` method was not adding signatures when forwarding emails to engineering@orion-contracting.com.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Remove HTML Escaping from Email Templates

**File: `resources/views/emails/user-general-email-gmail.blade.php`**
```php
// BEFORE:
{!! nl2br(e($bodyContent)) !!}

// AFTER:
{!! $bodyContent !!}
```

**File: `resources/views/emails/user-general-email.blade.php`**
```php
// BEFORE:
{!! nl2br(e($bodyContent)) !!}

// AFTER:
{!! nl2br($bodyContent) !!}
```

**File: `resources/views/emails/general-email.blade.php`**
```php
// BEFORE:
{!! nl2br(e($body)) !!}

// AFTER:
{!! nl2br($body) !!}
```

**Note:** We removed the `e()` function because the body content now includes HTML signatures that should not be escaped.

### Fix 2: Add Signatures in TaskController

**File: `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php`**

Added signature generation and appending in the `sendGeneralEmail()` method:

```php
// Add signature to email body
$signatureService = app(\App\Services\EmailSignatureService::class);
$signature = $signatureService->getSignatureForEmail($user, 'html');
$bodyWithSignature = nl2br(e($validated['body'])) . '<br><br>' . $signature;
```

**Important:** We apply `nl2br(e())` to the user's input body to escape any malicious HTML, then append the trusted signature HTML. This maintains security while allowing signatures to display properly.

### Fix 3: Add Signatures in Notification Emails

Updated the `sendGeneralEmailNotification()` method to include signatures:

```php
// Add signature to notification email body
$signatureService = app(\App\Services\EmailSignatureService::class);
$signature = $signatureService->getSignatureForEmail($user, 'html');
$bodyWithSignature = nl2br(e($emailData['body'])) . '<br><br>' . $signature;
```

## Security Considerations

### XSS Protection Maintained
Even though we removed escaping from email templates, we still maintain XSS protection by:

1. **Escaping user input before adding signature**: User-typed content is escaped with `e()` in the controller
2. **Trusting only signature service output**: Only the signature HTML (generated by the system) is left unescaped
3. **Separation of concerns**: User input and system-generated content are processed separately

### Before Fix (Vulnerable to display issues):
```php
Template: {!! nl2br(e($bodyWithSignature)) !!}
// This escaped EVERYTHING including signatures
```

### After Fix (Secure and functional):
```php
Controller: $body = nl2br(e($userInput)) . '<br><br>' . $signature;
Template: {!! $body !!}
// User input is escaped in controller, signature is trusted HTML
```

## How Email Signatures Work Now

### 1. Profile Preview
- Users can see how their signature will appear in HTML and plain text formats
- The preview updates automatically when profile information changes
- Users can refresh the preview manually using the refresh button

### 2. Task Confirmation Emails
Signatures are added in `app/Mail/TaskConfirmationMail.php`:
```php
$signature = $this->signatureService->getSignatureForEmail($this->sender, 'html');
// Template: {!! $signature !!}
```

### 3. General Emails (Gmail OAuth)
Signatures are added in `app/Services/UserEmailService.php`:
```php
$bodyWithSignature = $body . '<br><br>' . $signature;
```

### 4. General Emails (SMTP Fallback)
Signatures are added in the same `UserEmailService` for SMTP:
```php
$bodyWithSignature = $body . '<br><br>' . $signature;
```

### 5. User-Sent General Emails
Signatures are now added in `TaskController::sendGeneralEmail()`:
```php
$bodyWithSignature = nl2br(e($validated['body'])) . '<br><br>' . $signature;
```

## Signature Content

### HTML Signature Includes:
- Company logo (Orion Contracting)
- User's profile image (if uploaded and not default)
- User's name (as clickable link with accent color)
- Position and department
- Email address (clickable mailto link)
- Mobile number (clickable tel link, if provided)
- Company information footer

### Plain Text Signature Includes:
- User's name
- Position and department
- Email address
- Mobile number (if provided)
- Company information

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Profile Signature Preview
1. Go to your profile page
2. Scroll to "Email Signature Preview" section
3. Verify HTML signature displays correctly with:
   - Company logo
   - Your name and email
   - Your position and department
   - Your mobile number (if set)
4. Switch to "Plain Text" tab
5. Verify plain text signature displays correctly

### Test 2: Send General Email
1. Go to any task or use the general email form
2. Compose and send an email
3. Check the received email
4. Verify signature appears at the bottom with proper formatting

### Test 3: Send Task Confirmation Email
1. Complete a task and prepare email
2. Send the confirmation email
3. Check the received email
4. Verify signature appears at the bottom

### Test 4: Engineering Notification
1. Send a general email (as above)
2. Check engineering@orion-contracting.com inbox
3. Verify the notification email also includes the signature

## Files Modified

1. `resources/views/emails/user-general-email-gmail.blade.php` - Removed HTML escaping
2. `resources/views/emails/user-general-email.blade.php` - Changed escaping approach
3. `resources/views/emails/general-email.blade.php` - Changed escaping approach
4. `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php` - Added signature generation in two methods
5. `EMAIL_SIGNATURE_FIX.md` - This documentation file

## No Changes Needed

These files already handled signatures correctly:
- `app/Services/EmailSignatureService.php` - Signature generation logic
- `app/Services/UserEmailService.php` - Already added signatures
- `resources/views/profile/partials/email-signature-preview.blade.php` - Preview display
- `resources/views/emails/task-confirmation.blade.php` - Already included signature
- `app/Mail/TaskConfirmationMail.php` - Already processed signatures

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- resources/views/emails/user-general-email-gmail.blade.php
git checkout HEAD -- resources/views/emails/user-general-email.blade.php
git checkout HEAD -- resources/views/emails/general-email.blade.php
git checkout HEAD -- app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php
```

## Additional Notes

### Signature Customization
Users can customize their signatures by updating:
- Profile image (Profile → Profile Image)
- Mobile number (Profile → Update Profile Information → Mobile)
- Position (Profile → Update Profile Information → Position)

### Default Images
Users with default profile images (default.png, default.jpg, 1.png) will have signatures without profile pictures, keeping the signature clean and professional.

### Department Assignment
- Admins and Managers: "Engineering Department"
- Other roles: "Engineering Team"

## Support

If signatures still don't appear after these fixes:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Check the sent email's HTML source
3. Verify your profile information is complete
4. Check Laravel logs for any email sending errors: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
