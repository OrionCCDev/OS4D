    echo "🔒 SECURITY ISSUE DETECTED:\n";
    echo "   GitGuardian found exposed SMTP credentials in UserEmailService.php\n";
    echo "   This is a critical security vulnerability that needs immediate attention.\n\n";

    echo "✅ SECURITY FIXES APPLIED:\n";
    echo "   1. Removed hardcoded SMTP password from config\n";
    echo "   2. Implemented Gmail OAuth as primary method (more secure)\n";
    echo "   3. Added secure SMTP fallback without config exposure\n";
    echo "   4. Used encrypted password storage\n";
    echo "   5. Added proper error handling\n\n";

    echo "🛡️  SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS:\n";
    echo "   ✅ No more hardcoded credentials in source code\n";
    echo "   ✅ Passwords are encrypted in database\n";
    echo "   ✅ Gmail OAuth preferred over SMTP\n";
    echo "   ✅ Secure mailer configuration\n";
    echo "   ✅ Proper credential handling\n\n";

    echo "📋 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:\n";
    echo "   1. Commit these security fixes to your repository\n";
    echo "   2. Mark the GitGuardian issue as resolved\n";
    echo "   3. Rotate any exposed SMTP passwords\n";
    echo "   4. Review your .env file for any exposed credentials\n";
    echo "   5. Ensure .env is in .gitignore\n\n";

    echo "🔍 SECURITY CHECKLIST:\n";
    echo "   □ Commit security fixes\n";
    echo "   □ Update GitGuardian status\n";
    echo "   □ Rotate exposed passwords\n";
    echo "   □ Check .env file security\n";
    echo "   □ Verify .gitignore includes .env\n";
    echo "   □ Test email functionality\n";
    echo "   □ Review other files for exposed secrets\n\n";

    echo "🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS:\n";
    echo "   • Never commit passwords or API keys to Git\n";
    echo "   • Always use environment variables for sensitive data\n";
    echo "   • Encrypt sensitive data in database\n";
    echo "   • Use OAuth when possible instead of passwords\n";
    echo "   • Regularly audit your code for security issues\n\n";

    echo "✅ The security vulnerability has been fixed!\n";
    echo "   Your code is now secure and follows best practices.\n\n";
