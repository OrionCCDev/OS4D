# Fair User Evaluation System

## Overview

This evaluation system ensures **equality and fairness** by normalizing user scores against team averages. Every user gets a true and fair evaluation based on:

- âœ… Task completion rates
- âœ… Progress percentages
- âœ… Internal rejection counts
- âœ… On-time completion vs overdue tasks
- âœ… Quality of work (rejection rate)

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Fair Scoring Algorithm**
- **Completion Score (25%)**: How many tasks you complete vs team average
- **Quality Score (35%)**: How often your work is rejected (lower rejection = higher score)
- **Timeliness Score (25%)**: How often you meet deadlines vs team average
- **Productivity Score (15%)**: How fast you complete tasks

### ðŸ“Š **Normalization for Equality**
Scores are normalized against team averages to ensure fairness:
- If you perform at team average = 50 points
- If you perform above average = >50 points
- If you perform below average = <50 points

This means **everyone gets evaluated on the same scale**, regardless of workload.

## Scoring Details

### Completion Rate Score
```php
Completed Tasks / Total Tasks * 100
Normalized against team average
```

### Quality Score
```php
100 - (Rejected Tasks / Total Tasks * 100)
Lower rejection rate = Higher quality score
```

### Timeliness Score
```php
On-Time Completions / Completed Tasks * 100
Based on completing before due date
```

### Productivity Score
```php
Average days per task completion
Faster completion = Higher score
```

## Example Scenario

### User A:
- Total Tasks: 10
- Completed: 8
- Rejected: 1
- On-Time: 7
- Avg Days: 5

**Scores:**
- Completion: 80% â†’ Normalized: 60
- Quality: 90% â†’ Normalized: 65
- Timeliness: 87.5% â†’ Normalized: 58
- Productivity: 50% â†’ Normalized: 55

**Overall: 59.5 (Grade: C+)**

### User B (Same period):
- Total Tasks: 15
- Completed: 12
