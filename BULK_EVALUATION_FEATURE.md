## Features

### Automatic Evaluation Creation
- Creates evaluation records for all non-admin users
- Updates existing evaluations if they already exist for the period
- Stores evaluations in the `employee_evaluations` table

### Intelligent Ranking
- Users are automatically ranked by performance score
- Top 3 performers get special badges (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Color-coded performance scores:
  - Green (Excellent): 80+
  - Blue (Good): 60-79
  - Yellow (Average): 40-59
  - Red (Poor): Below 40

### Comprehensive Metrics
Each user evaluation includes:
- Total tasks assigned

- Completion rate percentage
- On-time completion rate

- Overall performance score

### Professional PDF Output

## Technical Details

### Database
- Evaluations are stored in the `employee_evaluations` table
- Uses `updateOrCreate()` to prevent duplicates
- Links evaluations to the user who generated them

### Performance Calculation
Uses the existing `calculateUserMetrics()` and `calculateAdvancedPerformanceScore()` methods:
- Considers task completion, on-time delivery, rejections, and overdue tasks
- Applies experience multipliers based on total tasks
- Scores range from 0 to 100

### File Naming Convention
```
All_Users_Evaluation_{type}_{period}_{date}.pdf

Examples:
- All_Users_Evaluation_monthly_October_2025_2025-10-20.pdf
- All_Users_Evaluation_quarterly_Q3_2025_2025-10-20.pdf
- All_Users_Evaluation_annual_2025_2025-10-20.pdf
```

## Error Handling
- Form validation ensures all required fields are filled
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Error messages display if generation fails
- Success notifications confirm completion
- Automatic page reload after successful generation

## Benefits

1. **Time Saving**: Evaluate all users with a single click
2. **Consistency**: All users evaluated using the same criteria and period
3. **Documentation**: Automatic PDF generation for record-keeping
4. **Transparency**: Clear rankings and metrics for all team members
5. **Easy Sharing**: Download and share PDF reports with management
