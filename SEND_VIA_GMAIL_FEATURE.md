## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

**File**: `resources/views/tasks/email-preparation.blade.php`

#### 1. Information Notice (Lines 586-598)
```php
<!-- Recommended Method Notice -->
<div class="alert alert-info" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4299e1 0%, #3182ce 100%);">
    <h5>✨ Recommended: Send via Your Gmail</h5>
    <p>Click "Send via Gmail" to open Gmail with everything pre-filled...</p>
</div>
```

#### 2. New Buttons (Lines 600-625)
- Send via Gmail button (id: `sendViaGmailBtn`)
- Mark as Sent button (id: `markAsSentBtn`)
- Modified existing Send Email button to "Send via Server"

#### 3. JavaScript Functions (Lines 959-1080)

**sendViaGmailBtn Event Listener**:
- Gathers email data from form
- Builds Gmail compose URL with parameters:
  * `view=cm` (compose mode)
  * `fs=1` (full screen)
  * `to=` (recipients)
  * `cc=` (CC addresses)
  * `bcc=` (BCC addresses)
  * `su=` (subject)
  * `body=` (plain text body)
- Opens Gmail in new tab
- Shows user instructions
- Optionally saves draft

**markAsSentBtn Event Listener**:
- Confirms with user
- Sends POST request to backend
- Updates task status
- Redirects to task page

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Route Addition
**File**: `routes/web.php` (Line 194)
```php
Route::post('tasks/{task}/mark-email-sent', [TaskController::class, 'markEmailAsSent'])
    ->name('tasks.mark-email-sent');
```

#### 2. Controller Method
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php` (Lines 797-855)

**Method**: `markEmailAsSent(Request $request, Task $task)`

**Functionality**:
- Checks user permissions (assigned user or manager)
- Finds latest email preparation (draft or processing status)
- Updates email preparation:
  * `status` → 'sent'
  * `sent_at` → current timestamp
  * `sent_via` → 'gmail_manual'
- Updates task status → 'on_client_consultant_review'
- Notifies managers
- Returns success response with redirect URL

### Gmail Compose URL Format

```
https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=email@example.com&cc=cc@example.com&su=Subject&body=Body%20text
```

**Parameters**:
- `view=cm` - Compose mode
- `fs=1` - Full screen
- `to=` - Recipient email(s)
- `cc=` - CC email(s)
- `bcc=` - BCC email(s)
- `su=` - Subject line
- `body=` - Email body (URL encoded plain text)

## 📝 Database Changes (Optional)

If the `sent_via` column doesn't exist in `task_email_preparations` table, it will silently fail but still work. To properly track sending method:

```php
// Migration to add sent_via column
Schema::table('task_email_preparations', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('sent_via')->nullable()->after('sent_at');
});
```

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

- Only **assigned user** or **managers** can send emails
- Only **assigned user** or **managers** can mark as sent
- Task must be in `ready_for_email` or `approved` status
- Email preparation must be in `draft` or `processing` status

## 📱 User Instructions

### For Users

**When you need to send a confirmation email:**

1. Click "Prepare Email" on the task
2. Fill in all details (To, Subject, Body)
3. Click "Save Draft" to save your work
4. Click **"Send via Gmail (Recommended)"** (big red button)
5. Your Gmail will open in a new tab with everything filled in
6. **Important**: Manually attach any required files in Gmail
7. Review everything and click Send in Gmail
8. Come back to this page
9. Click **"Mark as Sent (After Gmail)"** button
10. Done! Task status is updated automatically

### What Gets Pre-Filled in Gmail

✅ To addresses
✅ CC addresses  
✅ BCC addresses
✅ Subject line
✅ Email body (as plain text)

❌ Attachments (you must attach manually)

### Why Manual Attachments?

Gmail's URL API doesn't support pre-attaching files for security reasons. This is a Gmail limitation, not an application limitation.

## 🆚 Comparison: Gmail vs Server

| Feature | Send via Gmail | Send via Server |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Reliability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Attachment Issues | None | Possible |
| Configuration Required | None | Server setup |
| Sent Folder | Your Gmail | Application only |
| Deliverability | Excellent | Varies |
| Manual Steps | Attach files | None |
| **Recommended** | **✅ YES** | For automation |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Gmail didn't open"
- Check popup blocker settings
- Click button again
- Try different browser

### "Email not pre-filled correctly"
- Ensure all fields are filled before clicking
- Save draft first
- Check browser console for errors

### "Mark as Sent doesn't work"
