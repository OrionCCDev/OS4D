# Time Extension Notifications - Enhanced

## Overview
Enhanced notification system for time extension requests to ensure both managers and users receive proper notifications at all stages.

## Notification Flow

### 1. User Requests Extension
**Who gets notified:** All managers (admin, manager, sub-admin)
**Title:** "Time Extension Requested"
**Message:** Includes requester name, number of days, task title, and reason
**Priority:** High
**Example:**
```
Ahmed requested 5 day(s) extension for task 'Design Homepage'.
Reason: Need more time to complete the design revisions.
```

### 2. Manager Approves
**Who gets notified:** Task assignee (the user who requested)
**Title:** "Time Extension Approved"
**Message:** Includes approval, days added, and new due date
**Priority:** High
**Example:**
```
Your time extension request for task 'Design Homepage' has been approved. 
5 days added to due date. New due date: Dec 15, 2025.
```

### 3. Manager Rejects
**Who gets notified:** Task assignee (the user who requested)
**Title:** "Time Extension Rejected"
**Message:** Includes rejection notice and manager's reason
**Priority:** High
**Example:**
```
Your time extension request for task 'Design Homepage' has been rejected. 
Reason: Deadline cannot be extended due to client commitment.
```
