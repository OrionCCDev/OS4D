# Top 3 Competition - How Your Performance Score is Calculated

## Overview

The **Top 3 Competition** on the Manager Dashboard ranks team members based on their **Performance Score**, not just the number of tasks completed. This ensures that quality work is rewarded, not just quantity.

---

## 📊 How Your Performance Score Works

Your performance score is calculated monthly and considers multiple factors:

### ✅ Points You EARN:

| Activity | Points Per Task |
|----------|----------------|
| **Completed Task** | 10 points |
| **Task In Progress** | 5 points |
| **On-Time Completion** | +3 points bonus |
| **Completion Rate** | +0.5% bonus |

### ⚠️ Penalties You FACE:

| Issue | Deducted Points |
|-------|----------------|
| **Rejected Task** | -8 points |
| **Overdue Task** | -5 points |
| **Late Completion** | -2 points |

### 🚀 Experience Multiplier

The more tasks you handle, the higher your multiplier (up to 1.4x):

| Total Tasks Completed | Multiplier |
|----------------------|------------|
| 0-5 tasks | 1.0x (New) |
| 6-15 tasks | 1.1x (Beginner) |
| 16-30 tasks | 1.2x (Experienced) |
| 31-50 tasks | 1.3x (Veteran) |
| 50+ tasks | 1.4x (Expert) |

## 📐 Calculation Formula

```
Base Score = (Completed × 10) + (In Progress × 5) + (On-Time × 3) + (Completion Rate × 0.5)

Penalties = (Rejected × 8) + (Overdue × 5) + (Late × 2)

Final Score = (Base Score × Experience Multiplier) - Penalties
```

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: High Performer
**Mohamed** completed 12 tasks this month:
- 12 Completed = 120 points
- Experience Multiplier = 1.2x (Experienced)
- 0 Penalties

**Calculation:**
- Base: 120 points
- Multiplier: 1.2x
- **Final Score: 144 points** 🏆

---

### Example 2: Good Worker with Some Issues
**Ahmed** completed 8 tasks:
- 8 Completed = 80 points
- Experience Multiplier = 1.1x (Beginner)
- 2 Overdue tasks = -10 points
- 1 Rejected task = -8 points

**Calculation:**
- Base: 80 points
- Multiplier: 1.1x = 88 points
- Penalties: -18 points
- **Final Score: 70 points** 🥈

---

### Example 3: Quantity vs Quality
**Mahmoud** has:
- 15 Completed = 150 points
- Experience Multiplier = 1.0x (New)
- 5 Rejected tasks = -40 points

**Calculation:**
- Base: 150 points
- Multiplier: 1.0x = 150 points
- Penalties: -40 points
- **Final Score: 110 points** 🥉

**Even though Mahmoud completed more tasks, Mohamed ranks higher because her work is higher quality (no rejections or overdue tasks).**

---

## 🎯 Ranking Rules

1. **Performance Score** (highest to lowest)
2. **Completion Rate** (highest first)
3. **Total Tasks** (highest first)

### Important Notes:

- **Quality matters**: Completing 10 high-quality tasks beats 20 poorly done tasks
- **Timeliness matters**: On-time completion earns bonuses
- **Penalties hurt**: Even one rejected task significantly impacts your score
- **Experience helps**: Consistent performance over time increases your multiplier

---

## 📅 Time Period

- **This Month**: Tasks from the 1st to today
- **This Quarter**: Tasks from the start of current quarter
- **This Year**: Tasks from January 1st to today

You can switch between these periods on the dashboard.
