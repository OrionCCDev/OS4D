**Subject:** How Top 3 Competition Ranking Works - New Performance Scoring System

**Hi Team,**

We've updated the Top 3 Competition ranking system to make it fairer and more accurate. Here's how your performance is now calculated:

---

## 🎯 How Your Score is Calculated

Your ranking is based on a **Performance Score**, not just task counts. This means:

✅ **Quality matters** - Well-done work is rewarded  
✅ **Timeliness matters** - On-time completion earns bonuses  
✅ **Experience matters** - Consistent performers get multiplier bonuses  
❌ **Penalties apply** - Rejections and overdue tasks hurt your score  

---

## 📊 Scoring Breakdown

### You EARN points for:
- **Completing tasks**: 10 points each
- **Working on tasks**: 5 points each (in progress)
- **On-time completion**: +3 bonus points
- **Good completion rate**: +0.5% bonus

### You LOSE points for:
- **Rejected work**: -8 points ⚠️
- **Overdue tasks**: -5 points  
- **Late completions**: -2 points

### Experience Multiplier:
The more tasks you complete over time, the higher your bonus:
- 0-5 tasks: 1.0x (New)
- 6-15 tasks: 1.1x
- 16-30 tasks: 1.2x
- 31-50 tasks: 1.3x
- 50+ tasks: **1.4x (Expert level)**

---

## 💡 Simple Example

**Scenario:** Two team members compete

**Person A:**
- Completes 8 tasks perfectly = 80 points
- No rejections or overdue = 0 penalties
- Experience multiplier 1.3x
- **Final Score: 104 points** 🏆

**Person B:**
- Completes 12 tasks = 120 points
- But 3 rejected = -24 points
- 2 overdue = -10 points
- Experience multiplier 1.0x
- **Final Score: 86 points** 🥈

**Result:** Person A wins despite fewer tasks because quality matters more!

## 🎯 How to Improve Your Ranking

1. **Focus on quality** - Fewer perfect tasks beat many imperfect ones
2. **Meet deadlines** - Avoid overdue penalties (-5 points each!)
3. **Avoid rejections** - One rejection costs you 8 points
4. **Stay consistent** - Build your experience multiplier
5. **Keep tasks active** - In-progress work also earns points
