# 🎉 Implementation Complete - Send Email via Gmail Feature

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've implemented **exactly what you requested** - a way for users to send emails through their own Gmail account instead of through the server. This **completely solves** the attachment and email sending issues!

### Now you have:

   - Most prominent button on the page
   - Has Gmail icon

2. **Information Notice**: Blue box at top explaining why Gmail method is better

3. **Clear Workflow**:
   ```

   ```
